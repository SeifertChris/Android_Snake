 *
 * This is new class to for all the constants for table AKA BaseColumn
 *
 * By implementing the BaseColumns interface, we begin to set up the underpinnings for using database-friendly user
 * interface controls in the future, which often require a specially named column called _id to function properly.
 * We rely on this column as our primary key.
