IT4784 Capella University Android Project
This is a project from Capella University's IT4784 class that I have worked on. This project is the traditional snake game. Although, the task was to add Media, SQL Database, animation, Cloud functionality and social media authentication and integration. This project was fun to work on and I thought that others maybe able to use this as a learning experience. This project has shown me a great deal of insight on programming Android applications.
